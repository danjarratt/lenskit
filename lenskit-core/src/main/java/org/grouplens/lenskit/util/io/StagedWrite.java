/**
 * Helper to do staged file writes.  In a staged write, code first writes the output to a temporary
 * file, then renames the temporary file on top of the target file. To use this file:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * StagedWrite stage = StagedWrite.begin(outputFile);
 * try {
 *     OutputStream stream = stage.openOutputStream();
 *     // write to stream
 *     stream.close();
 *     stage.commit();
 * } finally {
 *     stage.close();
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The logic used to implement this class is subject to race conditions, so it should not be used
 * when multiple threads or processes may attempt to write the same file.  In LensKit 3.0, the race
 * condition will be removed on systems exposing POSIX file system semantics, but the APIs needed
 * for us to provide that capability are not present on Java 6.
